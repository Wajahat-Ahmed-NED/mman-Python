Hello brother,

I am attaching 2 files. 

main_dup: works very well and updates the table perfectly. Where I modified it based on your previous version. 

main_orig: is your latest FASTAPI code. I did a little change just to check if it makes connection with database or not. I am getting error when I run it with uvicorn. Please see the error file. 
The bot says "I have cancelled your membeership succesully", but table is not updating. Error shows it is released with sqlalchemy. Can we change it, or replace it? But I know it works in your machine. 

No worries, I will cover your time to this. 

Thank you!
